# Tutorial to run nuSVR Deconvolution on Cell Free RNA using Tabula Sapiens v 1.0 üß¨ ü©∏ ü´Å  üß† ü´Ä

Please note (prior to running code):
* Do *not* pass in samples in log-transformed space. For a full proof for why this is inappropriate, please check out this reference: (Zhong, Y. & Liu, Z., Nature Methods 2012)
* The fractions that come out of this program using this program denote the relative fractional contributions of cell type specific RNA for the 23 tissues from which these cell types originate (if using the Tabula Sapiens v1.0 basis matrix) 
* If you are looking for signal from a specific tissue-specific cell type in cfRNA, it is advised to perform signature scoring (see Methods section) in conjunction with systems-level deconvolution. A lot of cell types have very small fractions in systems deconvolution that can be masked by predominant cell types. Going in with a specific gene list can be a better way to measure this signal.

To deconvolve samples:

* Step 1: Create the conda environment
	* Create the conda environment with the packages using 'cfrna_deconv.yml'

* Step 2: Determine the basis matrix
	* Tabula Sapiens v1 basis matrix (as in this work): unzip the basis matrix (`gunzip tsp_v1_basisMatrix.txt.gz`)
	* Custom basis matrix: make sure that you have the valid file path.
		-  Required format: first column is a list of genes and each subsequent column corresponds to a sample 
	* üö® IMPORTANT NOTES
		- If using a custom basis matrix, update the header of `deconvolve.py` with its path
		- The units must match between the basis matrix two (e.g. both CPM or both TPM, etc) and **there must be no log-transformation**. If you're using the TSP v1 basis matrix, the units are CPM. 


* Step 3: Provide the bulk RNA samples you will deconvolve
	- üö® IMPORTANT NOTES
		- If you are using the TSP v1 basis matrix, your samples *must* be CPM-normalized. If you're working with cfRNA, normalize for plasma volume too.
		- If you are using your own basis matrix, the normalization units of the samples must correspond to the normalization scheme of the basis matrix. 
		- Ensure that your sample file path corresponds to a file where the first column is a list of genes and each subsequent column corresponds to a single sample. Check out the sample sheet need be.
		- The genes must have the same naming convention as that of the basis matrix. If you're using the TSP v1 basis matrix, use gene names (e.g. "NRGN" etc). Ensembl ID or Entrez gene ID will not work.
 
* Step 4: Generate the deconvolution job files
	- Open `sh_1.py` and your sample file path in the header. Fill in the requested fields, close (`:wq`), and run.
	- If deconvolving a lot of samples, just run `sh_1.py` as its own job, otherwise just run in the terminal (e.g. `python3 sh_1.py`)
	**the output will be a set of `.sh` files, each corresponding to a sample**

* Step 5: Launch the deconvolution jobs
	- Launch all sample deconvolution jobs simultaneously: `for i in *.sh ; do sbatch $i ; done`

* Step 6: When your jobs complete, run `merge_2.py`, this will write out two files, one of all the deconvoled fractions and one with the corresponding support vectors for each sample.

* Step 7: Analyze data :) 

**Please note that there was a lot of erythrolysis in the samples in the tutorial here, hence the large erythrocyte fractions**
